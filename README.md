# Los-Santos-Summer-Special-Cars-FiveM
This adds cars from the Los Santos Summer Special GTA Online update to FiveM. The cars have full customization, though first person does not currently work.

I recommend installing Diamond Casino Heist Vehicles and Diamond Casino and Resort Vehicles.

You will need to use a menu like vMenu for FiveM in order to spawn these vehicles. If you use vMenu, add the vehicle model name you want to spawn into addon spawner in vMenu config,
like this (this includes all the vehicles from the update):

"vehicles": [
  "addonvehiclename1",
  "addonvehiclename2",
	"seminole2",
	"club",
	"coquette",
	"dukes3",
	"gauntlet5",
	"glendale2",
	"landstalker2",
	"manana2",
	"openwheel1",
	"openwheel2",
	"penumbra2",
	"peyote3",
	"tigon",
	"yosemite3",
	"youga3"
  ]
